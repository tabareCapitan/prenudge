(Please select the answer that is closest to your best guess),How do you think the average male college student's body weight changes during their freshman year? (Please select the answer that is closest to your best guess),Please select the answer that pertains to you below.,"Imagine that you are about to start college as a freshman. You will live in the dorms and eat most of your meals in the campus Dining Hall (for example, Washakie). You are now offered to enroll in a program designed to encourage students who eat at the Dining Hall to make healthy food choices.



The program is designed such that you get a number of ""tokens"". Each food item in the Dining Hall is worth a specific number of tokens, which is based on its caloric content. The number of tokens you get corresponds to your total recommended daily intake of calories. For each food item you choose, you need to give up the number of tokens that correspond to that particular food item (for example, you need to give up many tokens for a dessert, and no tokens for spinach). When you have used up all your tokens, you know you have reached your daily recommended caloric intake. (HOWEVER, even if you have used up all your tokens, you are still free to choose more food items -- the tokens are there to help make salient the caloric intake, but not to prevent anyone from eating more than recommended.)



Your payment for participating in this ""token""-program during a full semester would be a total of $300 (you would receive $100 for starting the program, and the additional $200 at the end of the semester, upon completion of the assignments that are part of the program). In addition to being offered to use the tokens, you would be asked to do weigh-ins a few times during the semester, as well as answer survey questions on how extensively you used the tokens.

If given the opportunity, as a freshman living in the dorms, would you have chosen to participate in the ""token""-program?","For me personally, I think the best way to keep me away from eating unhealthy food (such as pastries, candy, or unhealthy snacks) would be","For the U.S. as a whole, I think the best way to keep people away from eating unhealthy food (such as pastries, candy, or unhealthy snacks) would be","Compared to the average Wyoming student, I think I have ...","Wyoming has a property tax (11.5% on industrial property and 9,5% on commercial and residential property) and a sales tax on retail products (4%).
